'''
What do I need server_socket to do?
I need server to accept incoming connections 
Handle match making process
fetch and store data in db
Store instances of games and players in them as another process is initialising the game

When a client leaves what needs to happen?
1.    references to the client need to be removed from the activeSession dictionary and the game object 
2a.   other clients in the game need to be sent the new game object 
2b.   If there is no one left in the session remove it from the dictionary
3     Close ServerConnection and push and relevant info like player wallet to the db
